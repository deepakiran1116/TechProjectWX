# Defects in application
## Danger Game
1. No Text showing in Answer boxes - SEV1\
2. When selected second (wrong) answer, user navigates to home screen\
3. Image in Start game popup is broken-SEV3

## Bus Game
1. When user selects correct answer but clicked X in "Right answer" popup instead of selecting "Try next question" or "Check final score", then, Timer stops, if the correct answer is selected again, it shows wrong answer pop up. Click on try again too does not do any thing nor time is up - BLOCKER - SEV1\
2. Correct answer to second question is not selectable - SEV2

## Office Game
1. Text showing in Right answer pop up to be corrected. "work form home" instead of "work if possible" - SEV3

## Common Issues
1. There is another button/link below check score that is shown when a battle ground is completed - SEV3\
2. When user clicks on atleast once wrong answer and corrects it again, then user selects to go to leader board page, "Wrong answer" window just shows up on screen for a second and disappears. This issue is with restaurent and office - SEV3\
3. Entering large warrior name, does not show in score page

## Improvements
1. There is timer not required when questions are over when user is prompted to check score\
2. When there are no questions, no need to show start game pop up\
3. No way to play only one game without going back and forth leaderboard\
4. Pressing Enter after entering warrior name is working. User need to click "create warrior" button with mouse only\
5. If session times out, not showing any pop up or logged out but showing blank question
